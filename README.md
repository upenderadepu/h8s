H8s is a home infrastructure project that combines the power of Kubernetes with the security-first approach of Talos OS.
This project provides a my setup, designed specifically for home labs and personal cloud environments.

This cluster uses 2 N100 CPU-based mini PCs, both retrofitted with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of NVME SSDs. They are happily tucked away under my TV `:)`.

## Motivations

Doing a homelab Kubernetes cluster has been a source of a lot of joy for me personally. I got these mini PCs as I wanted to learn as much as possible when it came to:
- Best DevOps and SWE practices.
- Sharpen my Kubernetes skills (at work I heavily use Kubernetes).
- Bring some of the stack back back within my control.
- Self-host things that I find useful.

Most importantly: ***I find it fun!*** It keeps me excited and hungry at work and on my other personal projects.

## Features
- Automated Bootstrap - 8-stage fully declaritive pipeline for complete cluster provisioning from bare metal in under 10 mins.
- Container registry.
- Home-wide ad blocker and DNS.
- Internal certificate authority.
- Routing to private services only accessible at home.
- Secrets management.
- Metric and log observability.
- Full CI/CD capabilities.
- Internet access to services via Cloudflare. Give these a try:
    - [Excalidraw](https://draw.okwilkins.dev)
    - [Grafana](https://grafana.okwilkins.dev)
    - [Harbor](https://harbor.okwilkins.dev), you can pull from the `main` project here.
- Postgres databases for internal services like Terraform and Harbor.
- Full network encryption, observability, IPAM, kube-proxy replacement and L2 annoucements with Cilium.
